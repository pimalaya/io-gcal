//! # VTIMEZONE synthesis
//!
//! Synthesis of the VTIMEZONE an IANA time zone name stands for. The
//! Calendar API names a zone and stops there, while RFC 5545 3.2.19
//! makes every TZID a document references resolve to a VTIMEZONE that
//! same document carries, so a projection emitting the parameter owes
//! the component.
//!
//! Google's CalDAV frontend expands server-side and the REST API leaves
//! it to the caller, so the `ical` feature bundles the database through
//! `jiff/tzdb-bundle-always`: the document of record must read the same
//! on two machines, and on a container carrying no zoneinfo at all.
//!
//! A zone's record runs to hundreds of transitions, so [`vtimezone`]
//! describes the one era its anchor falls in. The United States moved
//! its rule in 2007, and an item from 1980 under today's rule would
//! read an hour out through the weeks between the two onsets.
//!
//! An observance states a yearly rule only where the transitions that
//! follow agree on one, and a zone whose nearest shift is more than
//! [`SETTLED`] from the anchor is described by its single offset, so
//! Hong Kong, which last shifted in 1979, carries no summer time today.
